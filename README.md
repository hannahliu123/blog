# Welcome to my Personal Blog!
Hi, I'm Hannah, and this is my blog which created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with a few tools in Firebase. When building this project, I met many challenges and setbacks, as many of the concepts were new to me. But because of these struggles I faced, finishing this project felt so much more rewarding compared to anything I've built in the past.<br/><br/>
I had so much fun throughout this process, and I'm super proud of each and every feature I added (especially figuring out anything Firebase-related like implementing my commenting and blog-posting systems)! I hope you'll check it out! Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or feedback. I truly appreciate it!

## Features
✅ Responsive Design<br/>
📃 Blog Post Generation w/ Javascript<br/>
🔎 Basic SEO<br/>
💭 Commenting & Replying<br/>
✨ Amazing Blog Posts (that you should definitely check out!)

I hope you enjoy!
