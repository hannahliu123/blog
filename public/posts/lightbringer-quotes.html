    <p class="content-text">Lightbringer by Pierce Brown was one of the best books I’ve ever read in my entire life. The book was so well thought out, and the writing felt so realistic to the point where I felt as if I was each of the characters in the story. This book was so memorable and contained some of my favorite quotes throughout the whole Red Rising series, so in honor of all the characters (especially my beloved Cassius 😭), I’ve gathered some of my favorite lines and scenes throughout the book to share. Reading these quotes is like being able to re-experience all the best moments of Lightbringer all over again. Each of these quotes sends a flood of emotions over you (whether good or bad), and I’ll never get sick of rewatching these precious moments.</p><h3 class="subheader">Table of Contents:</h3><a class="table-of-contents" href="#1">Funny Quotes</a><a class="table-of-contents" href="#2">Lysander Hate Quotes</a><a class="table-of-contents" href="#3">Emotional/Memorable Quotes</a><a class="table-of-contents" href="#4">Inspirational Quotes</a><p class="content-text"><br><b>WARNING:</b> Contains Spoilers!</p><p class="content-text"><i>Click on any dropdowns to reveal either specific thoughts or the background behind some of the quotes.</i></p><h2 class="header" id="1">Funny Quotes</h2><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>

<b>Darrow</b> (page 3)</pre></blockquote><p class="content-text"><details class="dropdown">
  <summary class="dropdown-summary">Thoughts</summary>
  <p class="dropdown-text">As one of the first memorable quotes in Lightbringer, this hits even harder after you’ve finished the book and read through all the character development and bonding (and tragedies 😭) between Darrow and Cassius.</p>
</details></p><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">He sighs. “Darrow, this is a thirty-megaton atomic warhead.”
I smile. “He has a big personality.”
“Well, then Apollonius should love him.”

<b>Darrow &amp; Cassius</b> (page 34)</pre></blockquote><p class="content-text"><details class="dropdown">
  <summary class="dropdown-summary">Thoughts</summary>
  <p class="dropdown-text">I laughed out loud when I read this scene. Cassius is absolutely hilarious (even more so than Ephraim in my opinion, fight me) and this was one of the first of many comedic scenes involving him and Darrow. I remember literally taking a picture of this quote and saving it on my phone when I first read it! We'll miss you Dominus Portobello 🫡 (but we'll always miss our Cassius more 😭)</p>
</details></p><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Apparently the material is one hundred times more expensive per ounce than razors are to produce,” I say. “Outfitting the Morning Star alone would have bankrupted the Republic.”
“So?” 
“That’s what I said.” 
He laughs. “No wonder the Senate didn’t like you.”

                                    <pre class="quote-text">"You idiot. What was that?" I shout. 
"You said 'Move’!" 
"The other way!" 
"You didn't specify which direction!" 
"Who dives into a bloodydamn cell?" I snap.

                                    <pre class="quote-text">“I can read lips from a hundred meters, you slanderous goat rapists.” 

<b>Tharsus</b> (page 59)</pre></blockquote><p class="content-text"><details class="dropdown">

<b>Cassius</b> (page 70)</pre></blockquote><p class="content-text"><details class="dropdown">
  <summary class="dropdown-summary">Background</summary>
  <p class="dropdown-text">This was after Darrow &amp; Cassius fell into the Minotaur's trap and Cassius discovered that Darrow was fed amazing food to prepare for his duel against Apollonius whilst he was uh… not <i>quite</i> as well fed.</p>

                                    <pre class="quote-text">I thought him a bad influence on Pax. Maybe I’ve underestimated my son. Maybe he was a good influence on Vladir.

                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Do not worry for her. Pity them."

<b>Victra's message to Mustang</b> (page 245)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Well, she pissed on Sevro and lived,” Cassius manages between fits of laughter. “Name one other person who’s done that.”

<b>Cassius</b> (page 343)</pre></blockquote><p class="content-text"><details class="dropdown">

  <p class="dropdown-text">This happened when Lyria was caught trying to steal ham on the Archimedes and Sevro caught her and enveloped her in a sack.</p>

                                    <pre class="quote-text">“You have a callsign already?” 
“Red Banshee,” I say. 
“It’s rude to start a friendship with lies,” he replies. “What is it really? You can be honest with me.” 
I grimace. “Truffle Pig.” 
“Oh dear.” A smile creeps across his face. “You really shouldn’t have told me that.”

<b>Cassius &amp; Lyria</b> (page 347)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Volga Fjorgan. This name ring a bell?” He snorts. I pull the sidearm I filched from the armory and set it on my knee. “Does her name ring a bell?” He chuckles. “What’s so funny?”
“You are saying: ‘Does this name ring my balls.’”

<b>Lyria and Sigurd</b> (page 457)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“You two haven’t seen each other fight–” 
“Cassius?” I say.
He perks up. “Yes?”
“Shut up,” Diomedes says.

<b>Cassius, Darrow, and Diomedes</b> (page 483)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Come, come, Darrow, am I not allowed to be the best at anything?” 
“Fine. You can be most despised,” I say.
“Thank you, contrition at last.”

<b>Cassius and Darrow</b> (page 483)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“What? Did somebody compliment me?” he asks. “It's the jawline. Isn't it selfless, really. I take the pressure off everyone else. They don't have to worry about being the most handsome in the room. They can just be. Ah. Heavy is the chin that sets the bar.”

<b>Cassius</b> (page 581)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">Volga jumps out the back of the ship and makes a beeline toward me. Her head is down under the wash of the ship’s engines. She glances at Cassius. She does a double take. He’s staring dramatically out to sea now, either thinking about Lysander or posing for a coin. She’s so captivated by him her foot clips an uneven stone. He doesn’t look over at me, but draws a finger along his jaw. Idiot. 

<b>Darrow’s POV</b> (page 582)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Honestly, Darrow, atomics, warlord heads. I thought our honeymoon would be more romantic.”
“Honeymoon.”
“Yes. Apparently we're a couple till Virginia fights me for you.”

                                    <pre class="quote-text">I extend a hand to him. “Au Raa. Or should I say Storm Knight? Or Legate? Or Twin Taker? You’re truly racking up the honors, goodman.” He does not take my hand. I’m shocked, embarrassed.

<b>Lysander to Diomedes</b> (page 62)</pre></blockquote><p class="content-text"><details class="dropdown">
  <summary class="dropdown-summary">Thoughts</summary>
  <p class="dropdown-text">HAHA TAKE THAT LYSANDER!!! Even though I know Diomedes ends up respecting Lysander (before that idiot bombs the Garter), I fully support any and all Lysander disrespect. If I’m going to be honest though, I never really hated Lysander until he killed Cassius. I thought his actions could be justified, as he really believed that he could reunite Rin and Core. I only started HATING, LOATHING, and DESPISING him after he betrayed Cassius for a biological weapon of mass extinction and then proceeded to cut his connections with the Rim and bomb their Garters. He either gaslit me really well, or he went through some terrible character development, but either way, I want to see him dead in Red God no matter what.</p>
</details></p><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“... I would ask you to relay that, but I hear you don’t share her confidences, only her bed.” He looks over at Diomedes. “The Core is an odd place, is it not?”

<b>Helios</b> (page 64)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“What’s frustrating is that he never comes into the field of battle so Victra can just kill the little bastard and end his delusions of grandeur before he becomes a problem.”

<b>Virginia</b> (page 139)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Go fuck yourself, Lysander.”

<b>Ajax</b> (page 149)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“He’ll pin all the evil on the Republic and on Atalantia, then take this war to the abyss so a snow-white savior can pull the worlds out into a shining dawn.” I laugh. Even the name of the ship is too rich. “Silenius the Light Bringer. Lysander the Light Bringer. That son of a bitch.”

<b>Darrow</b> (page 485)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">I have only one thing to say.
“That motherfucker’s gonna burn.”
Cassius and Diomedes both turn on me. “Darrow–”
“No, Cassius. I love you, but no. He is Atlas’s Good Tyrant. Don’t look at me like that. I’m gonna lather him in honey and feed him to the berserkers. I swear to Hades.”

<b>Darrow</b> (page 603)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">At first I did not recognize the young man. War has that effect on the face and eyes. It’s reassuring that it touches even the shiniest boy on the Palatine.

<b>Darrow</b> (page 611)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“You used me? For that? For this?” he asks. “To cut your strings and pin it all on me. The Betrayer.”
“Yes.”
He sways and looks around as if mortally wounded. “Lysander… I thought we were… I… believed in you.”
“You believed in your own reflection,” I say. “We’re not brothers. Let us go our separate ways. Take a nightRaptor. Fly away. Live. Escape this. I can’t. I won’t. I will be Sovereign.”

<b>Cassius &amp; Lysander</b> (pages 639-640)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Your strings are cut, Lysander. You’re free. We can take on Atlantia. Is that not enough?”
“It’s time for you to go, Cassius.”
He watches me for a moment.
“Say I don’t?”
“Then you’re choosing death.”

<b>Cassius &amp; Lysander</b> (page 640)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Lune, you are a liar. And your empty words are evil. We spoke of Atlas. You confessed his involvement–”

                                    <pre class="quote-text">“You wretched worm! Weasel,” Gaia snaps. “Foul tyrant seed. I spoke to my son Atlas. I looked in his face. I heard from his own mouth the game he has been playing.”

<b>Gaia</b> (page 657)</pre></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>

                                    <pre class="quote-text">He breaks eye contact. “They did smell like bacon, Darrow. The Howlers. I lost them all. I don’t know where Pebble and Clown are. I don’t know if Lilath and… the Abomination still have them. He said he was going to erase me. Wash out my memories. Turn me into his trained dog. Wash out my family.”

<b>Sevro</b> (page 107)</pre></blockquote><p class="content-text"><details class="dropdown">
  <summary class="dropdown-summary">Thoughts</summary>
  <p class="dropdown-text">Hearing this from Sevro absolutely broke me. I knew he was already depressed by this point in the book, but it was here that I realized how broken he really felt. His family and friends meant the world to him, and seeing him so vulnerable was heartbreaking.</p>
</details></p><blockquote class="quote"><p class="big-quote">“</p>
                                    <pre class="quote-text">“Can I ask something of you?” He nods. “You greeted me as your Sovereign, but–”
He steps forward and wraps his arms around me, and I wrap mine around him. It is the first embrace we’ve shared where I can feel a hint of the strength his arms will one day possess. I hold him for as long as I can.
He is my favorite smell, my favorite sound, my favorite sight. He will never know how much I love him because he does not remember the day Darrow and I conceived him, or the months I carried him inside me, or the minute he came into the world, the moment he said his first word or took his first step, or made me laugh for the first time. I remember all those things, and all the things about them. Where the sun lay in the sky, how his father’s eyes sparkled, what I feared in those moments, what I hoped for his life to be. That season of life is a haze to him, but when I die and reflect on my life, I know I will still believe that season was the meaning of mine.

  <p class="dropdown-text">This chapter ending was so beautifully written and emotional. I honestly never thought of how the Rim handled the revelation of all of the Sons of Ares, and I never really considered the fact that each and every one of them had their own lives and families. Reading this section as well as Darrow’s speech in the following chapter (chapter 60) felt really touching, and I enjoyed watching how Darrow lifted his burden and faced his guilt.</p>

“I’m not really blessed at keeping friends. But you are. I truly respect that. I know how special your friends are to you, how protective you are of them.

After years of friendship then rivalry, they finally became brothers again, just like how it should’ve been all along. Just reading this conversation makes me smile because of how wholesome it is. I’ve been waiting for this moment for SO long, and I can’t believe Pierce Brown would kill Cassius off right after he’s finally found himself. I guess this only adds to my hatred of that Palatine pixie who I hope ends up in Sevro’s hands to be picked apart bit by bit by the blade Sevro named after him. Nothing personal! 🙂</p>

If you’re interested (which you should be if you’ve gotten so far into this blog post), I would definitely check that post out once it’s released. I have some complex and amazing predictions that I can’t wait to share, but of course, I need to put them all into words first!</p><p class="content-text">Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed reading these iconic quotes as much as I have!
