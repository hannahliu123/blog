    <p class="content-text">If you enjoy reading dystopian novels, then you’ve come to the right place. After struggling for years to find a genre of books that I genuinely want to read, I’ve finally found a few authors and series that felt perfect for me. Here are my top three absolute favorites that I want to share with you!</p><p class="content-text">All spoilers have been blacked out. Click on any hidden sections like <span class="spoiler">this</span> to reveal the spoilers!</p><h2 class="header" id="1">3. <i>Legend</i> by Marie Lu</h2><img src="/blog-photos/legend.jpg" alt="blog-post-image" class="content-img"><p class="content-text">I finished this book within 24 hours, and I absolutely loved the plot and writing style. The concept of the Republic and Colonies is great, and I really appreciated the thought and details put into the story. The explanations behind each major plot scene <span class="spoiler">(ex. the death of June’s parents and brother as well as how the disease is was spread)</span> was so well thought out, and the way that Marie Lu shows the perspectives of both Day and June is really captivating, especially when the reader knows who each of them are and have gone through.</p><p class="content-text">With that said, the only issue I have with this book is that the plot seems a bit predictable at some points. I mean, June and Day just seem a little <i>too</i> perfect, both being absolute geniuses that happen to notice things practically no one else can. <span class="spoiler">These teenagers manage to outsmart the <i>entire</i> Republic system on their own! Additionally, throughout the entire book, I fully expected both Day and June to survive until the end of the book, but given that Day and June are the main characters, I guess it makes sense for them to have plot armor. Still, they always seem to survive and recover from their injuries rather quickly (<i>cough cough a 3-story fall</i>). Lastly, with the fast pace of the book, the readers never got much of a chance to connect with and grieve for John when he died, which is pretty disappointing considering how close Day was to him.</span></p><p class="content-text">Still, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, and I loved the plot. <span class="spoiler">Reading through how the relationship between Day and June developed, seeing how much Day cared for his family, and watching how June’s suspicions of her Republic built up was incredibly intriguing.</span> All in all, this was a great book, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading dystopian series. </p><p class="content-text"><b class="rating">Rating: 9/10</b></p><h2 class="header" id="2">2. <i>Sunrise on the Reaping</i> by Suzanne Collins</h2><img src="/blog-photos/sunrise-on-the-reaping.jpg" alt="blog-post-image" class="content-img"><p class="content-text">When I heard that a prequel novel for the Hunger Games was coming out, I knew I had to read it ASAP. This book did not disappoint, and I really enjoyed reading through Haymitch’s tragic backstory and understanding what he went through in his early life. I loved how his story not only aligns with the original <i>Hunger Games</i> trilogy, but also President Snow’s backstory with Lucy Gray from <i>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</i>.</p><p class="content-text">Throughout the book, even though I knew everyone in the games but Haymitch would die, each death hit just as hard <span class="spoiler">(especially Maysilee's). When I read through Haymitch’s last act of defiance at the end of his games, I almost thought he actually died, and when he fed Lenore the poisoned gumdrop, I could feel my heart beating faster as he panicked for a way to save his girl.</span></p><p class="content-text">This book was so beautifully written and thought out that I don’t even have many critiques. I guess I wish we got to hear more about Lenore Dove, Lucy Gray, and the Covey, but it may also be intentional that Suzanne Collins had Lenore keep so many secrets from Haymitch. <span class="spoiler">I’m also curious about a few small details, like how Plutarch was able to let Lenore talk to Haymitch and why he was even on the side of the rebels. I wish we got an explanation on whether Plutarch also had some kind of backstory leading him to help the rebels or if he wanted power like Coin.</span></p><p class="content-text">Nevertheless, I think this was an amazing (and emotional) prequel for the Hunger Games, and I felt so involved in the book the whole time I was reading it. If you enjoyed the original <i>Hunger Games</i> trilogy, you should definitely check this book out!</p><p class="content-text"><b class="rating">Rating: 9.5/10<b></b></b></p><h2 class="header" id="3">1. <i>Lightbringer</i> by Pierce Brown</h2><img src="/blog-photos/lightbringer.jpg" alt="blog-post-image" class="content-img"><p class="content-text">Finally, saving my new all time FAVORITE book for last, we have <i>Lightbringer</i> by Pierce Brown. This book is the 6th book of the <i>Red Rising</i> series (with one final book coming out in 2026). </p><p class="content-text">The book itself is 678 pages, and with five other books before it as well as multiple different perspectives in each book, this is one of the longest and most intricate series I’ve ever read, yet also the most deeply engaged into a series I’ve ever gotten. Because of the sheer length of this series, there are so many factors to account for at each point in time, so you truly never know what might happen next.</p><p class="content-text">Additionally, because barely any of the characters have plot armor, this adds even more unpredictability (and, unfortunately, sadness). Each and every death comes as a surprise and tugs at your heartstrings, and you never know who might end up being vulnerable to death. <span class="spoiler">When I read through Cassius's tragic death scene, I wanted to reach into the book and rip Lysander’s throat out and scream and stomp all over him. No, that’s an understatement. If you know, you know.</span> I feel so involved with and passionate about this series that I could seriously talk for hours about it.</p><p class="content-text">Pierce Brown’s writing is absolutely amazing, and the level of thought he puts into each of his books is beyond me. Each and every little detail mentioned could end up being a part of a huge plot twist. His writing makes you feel as if you are the character experiencing everything in the story and sharing all the pain, happiness, regret, and laughter along with the other characters.</p><p class="content-text">If you’re willing to invest in a long (but definitely worth it) series, then I <i>beg</i> you to starting the <i>Red Rising</i> series. The level of detail, plot development, and character development is incredible, and I can’t wait for the final book to come out! This series has raised my bar for books so high that I’m afraid I’ll never be able to find a book as great as this one.</p><p class="content-text"><b class="rating">Rating: 100/10</b> (no questions asked)</p><h2 class="header" id="4">Conclusion</h2><p class="content-text">If you’re looking to start a new book, then I highly recommend <i>Legend</i> by Marie Lu, <i>Sunrise on the Reaping</i> by Suzanne Collins, or <i>Red Rising</i> by Pierce Brown (the first book in <i>Lightbringer</i>’s series) depending on what type of book you’re looking for.</p><p class="content-text">If you want for a shorter yet action-packed book, then <i>Legend</i> is the book for you. </p><p class="content-text">If you loved the <i>Hunger Games</i> series, then you need to check out <i>Sunrise on the Reaping</i>. </p><p class="content-text">If you’re open to starting a longer series, and you enjoy reading dystopian novels, then <i>please</i> do yourself a favor and start the <i>Red Rising</i> series.</p><p class="content-text"><br>If anyone has any feedback, questions, or book recommendations, please leave a comment below or feel free to reach out to me <a href="mailto:hannah.liu2010@gmail.com">here</a> or with any of the icons on the  <a href="#page-bottom">footer</a>!
